# Task ID: 2
# Title: Fix Critical Functional Bugs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Address and resolve all critical functional bugs identified during the code review that affect core website functionality.
# Details:
Focus on fixing bugs that prevent users from accessing content or using core features. This includes broken links, non-functioning buttons, form submission issues, and content loading problems. Ensure all interactive elements work as expected. Maintain the existing design and structure while fixing these issues. Use the React/Next.js and TailwindCSS stack as per the original implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Test each fix individually to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems. Verify fixes across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Document all changes made and their impact.
