# Task ID: 14
# Title: Optimize Images and Assets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Prepare and optimize all images and visual assets for the website.
# Details:
Collect and organize all required images for the website. Optimize images for web using appropriate formats (WebP where supported, with JPEG/PNG fallbacks). Implement responsive images using Next.js Image component with multiple sizes. Create a consistent naming convention for all assets. Set up lazy loading for images to improve initial page load performance.

# Test Strategy:
Verify image loading performance using tools like Lighthouse. Check that images display correctly at different screen sizes. Test fallback behavior for browsers that don't support modern image formats.
