# Task ID: 1
# Title: Code Review and Bug Identification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a comprehensive code review of the existing Dva Smysly winery website to identify all functional bugs and issues.
# Details:
Review all React/Next.js components, TailwindCSS styles, and JavaScript functionality. Create a detailed list of all identified bugs, categorizing them by severity and affected components. Focus on interactive elements like links, buttons, and forms. Check for console errors, network issues, and rendering problems. Document all findings in a structured format for the team to address.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing of all website features and functionality. Use browser developer tools to identify console errors. Create a comprehensive bug report with screenshots and steps to reproduce each issue.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Static Component and UI Element Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a systematic review of all static components, UI elements, and styling across the Dva Smysly winery website to identify visual bugs, styling inconsistencies, and rendering issues.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an inventory of all pages and components to ensure complete coverage
2. Methodically review each page in multiple browsers and screen sizes
3. Check all TailwindCSS styling for responsiveness issues, overflow problems, and inconsistent styling
4. Inspect layout shifts, image rendering, typography, and color consistency
5. Document each issue with screenshots, browser/device information, and affected components
6. Categorize findings by severity (critical, major, minor, cosmetic)
7. Test for accessibility issues using browser dev tools
8. Check for console warnings related to styling or rendering

Testing approach:
- Use browser dev tools to inspect elements
- Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Use React DevTools to inspect component hierarchy

## 2. Interactive Element and Form Functionality Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Test all interactive elements including links, buttons, navigation, forms, and user flows to identify functional bugs and interaction issues.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a comprehensive list of all interactive elements from the component inventory
2. Test each link for correct routing, external links for proper opening behavior
3. Verify all button click handlers and state changes
4. Test all forms for validation, submission, error handling, and success states
5. Check navigation components for proper highlighting and state management
6. Test all dropdowns, modals, accordions, and other interactive UI patterns
7. Verify proper focus management and keyboard navigation
8. Document each issue with steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior
9. Categorize by severity and affected user flow

Testing approach:
- Manual testing with detailed reproduction steps
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors during interactions
- Test user flows end-to-end
- Verify network requests using Network tab in dev tools
- Test with both mouse and keyboard navigation

## 3. Code Structure and Performance Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Review the React/Next.js codebase structure, component architecture, and performance to identify code-level issues, inefficiencies, and potential improvements.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Analyze React component structure for proper composition and reusability
2. Review state management approach and identify potential inefficiencies
3. Check for memory leaks using Performance tab in dev tools
4. Analyze component re-rendering using React DevTools Profiler
5. Review network requests for optimization opportunities
6. Check for proper error boundaries and fallback handling
7. Identify unused code, components, or dependencies
8. Review Next.js configuration for optimal performance settings
9. Check bundle size and code splitting effectiveness
10. Compile findings into a structured document with code references
11. Prioritize issues based on performance impact and development effort

Testing approach:
- Use React DevTools Profiler to measure rendering performance
- Analyze Lighthouse scores for performance metrics
- Check network waterfall charts for loading optimization
- Review code using static analysis tools
- Test with throttled CPU and network conditions
