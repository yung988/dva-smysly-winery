# Task ID: 4
# Title: Image Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize all images on the website to improve loading times while maintaining visual quality.
# Details:
Audit all images used on the website. Implement modern image formats (WebP with fallbacks). Resize images to appropriate dimensions for their display size. Implement lazy loading for images below the fold using Next.js Image component or similar. Compress images to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable quality. Consider implementing responsive images with srcset for different viewport sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Compare before/after file sizes and loading times. Visually inspect optimized images to ensure quality is maintained. Test lazy loading functionality on various devices and connection speeds. Verify that images load correctly across all supported browsers.
