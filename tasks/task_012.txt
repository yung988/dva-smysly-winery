# Description: Implement a basic contact form for visitor inquiries.
# Details:
Design and implement a simple contact form with fields for name, email, phone (optional), subject (dropdown with options like 'Degustace', 'Firemní víno', 'Obecný dotaz'), and message. Include form validation for required fields and email format. Implement form submission handling that could either send an email or store the inquiry for later processing. Add appropriate success and error messages.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation for all fields. Verify that form submission works correctly and appropriate feedback is provided to users. Test the form on different devices to ensure responsive behavior.
