# Task ID: 5
# Title: Code Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize CSS and JavaScript code to improve rendering and execution performance.
# Details:
Analyze and refactor inefficient React components. Remove unused CSS and JavaScript. Implement code splitting for JavaScript bundles. Optimize TailwindCSS configuration to reduce bundle size (purge unused styles). Consider implementing critical CSS extraction. Review and optimize any animations or transitions that might affect performance. Ensure proper use of React hooks and memoization where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Compare bundle sizes before and after optimization. Measure rendering performance improvements using browser developer tools. Test user interactions to ensure they remain smooth and responsive. Verify that all functionality works correctly after optimization.
