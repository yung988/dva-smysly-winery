# Task ID: 8
# Title: Mobile Responsiveness Audit
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a comprehensive audit of the website's responsiveness across various device sizes.
# Details:
Test the website at standard breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) and identify any layout or usability issues. Check for proper scaling, readability, and touch targets on mobile devices. Verify that all content is accessible on smaller screens. Test navigation menus and interactive elements on touch devices. Ensure images and text are properly sized and positioned at all viewport widths.

# Test Strategy:
Use Chrome DevTools device emulation to test standard device sizes. Perform physical testing on actual mobile and tablet devices when possible. Create a detailed report of all responsive issues found, with screenshots at different viewport sizes.
