# Task ID: 9
# Title: Responsive Design Fixes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement fixes for all identified responsive design issues to ensure optimal display across all devices.
# Details:
Address all issues identified in the mobile responsiveness audit. Refine TailwindCSS responsive utility usage to ensure proper layout at all breakpoints. Optimize touch targets for mobile users (minimum 44x44px). Ensure text remains readable without zooming on mobile devices. Fix any overflow issues or horizontal scrolling problems. Adjust spacing and margins for better mobile experience while maintaining the original design aesthetic.

# Test Strategy:
Test each fix at multiple viewport sizes to ensure it works across the responsive spectrum. Verify fixes on physical devices when possible. Conduct usability testing on touch devices to ensure all interactive elements are easily accessible and functional.
